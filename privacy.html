  <h1>RizzCal AI Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated February 2025</p>

  <p>This privacy notice describes how we collect, store, use, and share your information when you use our services (“Services”), including when you download and use our mobile application <strong>RizzCal AI</strong>, or interact with us in other ways.</p>
  <p>If you do not agree with our policies and practices, please do not use our Services. If you have questions or concerns, please contact us at <a href="mailto:arturteplov00@gmail.com">arturteplov00@gmail.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>SUMMARY OF KEY POINTS</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>What we collect:</strong> Account information (if you sign in), meal and food log data, photos you submit for AI scanning (processed for nutrition only, not stored as images), device and usage information, and payment-related data when you make in-app purchases.</li>
    <li><strong>Sensitive information:</strong> We do not process sensitive personal information.</li>
    <li><strong>Third parties:</strong> We use service providers (e.g. cloud hosting, AI for food analysis, subscription billing). Payment data is handled by Apple and RevenueCat. We do not sell your personal information.</li>
    <li><strong>Why we process:</strong> To provide the app (scanning, logging, goals, Rizz score), improve our services, secure and operate the app, and comply with law.</li>
    <li><strong>Your rights:</strong> Depending on where you live, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict your data. Contact us to exercise them.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h2>
  <p><strong>Information you provide:</strong> When you sign in (e.g. email), create an account, or contact us, we collect what you give us. Meal and food data you log (names, calories, macros) are stored to provide the service. Photos you take for the AI food scanner are sent for analysis and are not stored as images after processing.</p>
  <p><strong>Payment data:</strong> If you make in-app purchases or subscriptions, payment is processed by Apple. We may receive transaction status (e.g. subscription active) via Apple and RevenueCat. We do not store your payment card details. Apple’s privacy policy: <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apple.com/legal/privacy</a>.</p>
  <p><strong>Application and device data:</strong> We may collect device type, OS version, app version, and usage information (e.g. features used, errors) to run and improve the app. If you enable push notifications, we use the necessary identifiers to deliver them; you can turn these off in your device settings.</p>
  <p><strong>Information collected automatically:</strong> When you use our Services, we may collect IP address, general location (e.g. country from IP) for security and analytics. We do not collect precise GPS location for the app.</p>

  <h2>2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
  <p>We process your information to provide, improve, and administer RizzCal AI, to communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with applicable law. We process only where we have a valid legal basis (consent, contract, legal obligation, or legitimate interests).</p>

  <h2>3. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
  <p>We may share information with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> Cloud and database hosting (e.g. Supabase), AI/image analysis (e.g. OpenAI for food recognition), and subscription/analytics (e.g. RevenueCat). These providers act on our instructions and under agreements that protect your data.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal and safety:</strong> When required by law, or to protect rights, safety, or property.</li>
    <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> In connection with a merger, sale of assets, or similar transaction, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not sell your personal information to third parties.</p>

  <h2>4. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
  <p>We keep your information only as long as needed for the purposes in this notice (e.g. to provide the app, resolve disputes, comply with law). When there is no ongoing need, we delete or anonymize it where possible.</p>

  <h2>5. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
  <p>We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data. No internet or electronic storage is 100% secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security. You use our Services at your own risk.</p>

  <h2>6. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
  <p>Depending on your location (e.g. EEA, UK, Switzerland, Canada, California), you may have the right to access, correct, delete, or restrict your personal information, or to object to processing. To exercise these rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:arturteplov00@gmail.com">arturteplov00@gmail.com</a>. You may also have the right to complain to a data protection authority.</p>
  <p>If we rely on your consent, you may withdraw it at any time by contacting us; that will not affect the lawfulness of processing before withdrawal.</p>

  <h2>7. DO NOT TRACK</h2>
  <p>There is no universal standard for “Do Not Track” signals. We do not currently respond to DNT browser signals.</p>

  <h2>8. CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS</h2>
  <p>If you are a California resident, you may have additional rights under the CCPA, including the right to know what we collect, to delete your data, and to non-discrimination. We do not sell personal information. To make a request, contact us at <a href="mailto:arturteplov00@gmail.com">arturteplov00@gmail.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>9. UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE</h2>
  <p>We may update this notice from time to time. The “Last updated” date at the top will change. We encourage you to review it periodically. Material changes may be communicated via the app or email where appropriate.</p>
